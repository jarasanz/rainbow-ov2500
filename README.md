# rainbow-ov2500
This Node.js app shows how to integrate ALE (Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise) Rainbow with OmniVista2500, in order to add users for WLAN authentication with 802.1X.

Will generate a BOT that will add users in "Employee Account" in OmniVista2500, using the information provided by the "sponsor" in Rainbow.

First thing is adding a new user to Rainbow organization, that will be used by the bot. For many reasons, this bot is called Daneel, but you can edit and change the name.
